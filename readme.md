# Particle Movement Through a Shallow Water Wave Field
**Model and code explanation provided in the pdf**

Consider a rectangular area with all sides enclosed:
* There are two points in the area that will periodically generate waves.
* These points can be considered source points and they both will generate a wave with the exact same amplitude at any given time.
* Next, consider a ball of some mass and initial velocity.
* This project will focus on the movement of the ball through the wave field using simple momentum equations to derive the interaction between the water and the ball.
